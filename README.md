# contenthub-scripts-unittest

This repo shows how to implement Unit Testing for Content Hub [Scripts](https://docs.stylelabs.com/contenthub/4.1.x/content/integrations/scripting-api/scripting-api-overview.html). I use this repo in one of my [blog posts](https://contenthublearnings.blogspot.com/2021/10/how-can-you-leverage-unit-testing-when.html). 

## What is scripting in Content Hub
*Sitecore Content Hubâ„¢ allows you to integrate custom scripts in your business logic. There are different script types with different context properties. Depending on the script type and the use case, you can trigger scripts manually, or have them automatically triggered by using Triggers.*
